		I am interested in how the mind works.
		Specifically the storage and encoding of memories.
		For me, the best way to communicate a story is through visuals and motion.
		However, these often get stifled in translation to and from language, gestures, and rendering.
		I am looking for a better way and when I find it I will tranq, bag, and patent it.
