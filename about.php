		Things I've played with (and enjoyed) include
		
		Blender 3D,
		Gimp,
		Inkscape,
		Processing,
		imageJ,
		Context Free,
		
		Arduino,

		I want to be able to wave my hands in the air and tell stories.
		Somewhere along the chain from memory to expression to communication someone always manages to fumble a piece here or there.
		I believe in the coordination of physical systems, computational interpretation, and artistic expression
		into a new kind of link between people.
