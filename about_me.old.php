	<p>I am a paragraph from over there. My sole purpose is to fill space. It is not a glorious purpose, nor one of particular importance to the state of things. But it is a good one, and it's all I've got. So I will continue to spew letters and spaces in coherent, visually pleasing (thought maybe not contentually such) patterns across the page. I hope I can pass this here image that should be on the left and get back to the left side of the content div where I belong. It really is a large image, isn't it. I wish it would go away so that my work here would be done.

I stand humbly in his place with many of the same goals and hopes. In addition to his quest for the left I also strive for a more magnificent goal. To reach the footer!
